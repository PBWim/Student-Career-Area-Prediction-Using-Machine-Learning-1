# EMPIRICAL-MODEL-FOR-STUDENT-CAREER-PREDICTION-SYSTEM
>>This project aims at comparision of various approches to predict the career area of a student based upon his capabilities,interests,personal data and other factors.
>>We compare various algorithms specially supervised like c4.5,c5 algorithms etc. to know which gives best results in terms of accuracy and performance.
>>we then tried to modify old approaches and design new algorithm which is more precise than previous algorithms.
